/**
 * [AppState] can be used as a shared store of state that lives at an "app"/"in-memory" level
 * rather than being tied to a specific component. This could be shared state between different
 * [Activity] objects or a way of communicating between a [Service] and other components.
 * [AppState] can be used as an alternative to Dagger singleton objects or static fields.
 *
 * [AppState] should not be used to share state between views or components on the same screen or make
 * up part of the same flow. For this, using Jetpack's [ViewModel] at either a [Fragment] or [Activity]
 * level is more appropriate.
 *
 * The easiest way to use [AppState] is have an instance owned by your app's [Application] object
 * and implement the [StateStore] interface:
 *
 * ```
 * class MyApplication : Application(), StateStore {
 *     private val appState = AppState()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The [AppState] instance can then be accessed anywhere the [Application] is available using the
 * [getState] extension function.
 *
